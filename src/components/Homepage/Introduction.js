    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>Founded by Nicole and Joe - two people (not too fast, not too slow) who enjoy running around the streets, fields, hills and parks of Hertford.</p>
    <p>Hertford Running Club is a very friendly, relaxed and welcoming community of runners; from Couch to 5k graduates to experienced runners.</p>
    <p>Often ‘getting out’ is the hardest part. Nicole and Joe are aiming to make this easier by creating a community of friends who run together, chat and enjoy the space we all live in. Plus, there will occasionally be snacks and treats!</p>

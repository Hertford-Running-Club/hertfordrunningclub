    <p>Currently the club meet twice a week. On Tuesday nights at 7:30pm we usually do one run as a larger group. This run might be a hill session, efforts session or tempo run depending on the week. We also meet on Sunday mornings at 9:00am where we offer a long run and a slightly shorter one. Usually the two routes are led by Nicole and Joe. All routes start and finish at Hertford House Hotel (our official HQ)</p>
